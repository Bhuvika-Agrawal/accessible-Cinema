# MovieAudioDescriber

This project aims to develop an AI-powered model to generate audio descriptions for movies, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired audiences.

## Project Overview
The system will process video files and provide audio descriptions by summarizing key scenes and narrating visual details. The model will use deep learning techniques like CNNs for video analysis and transformers for audio generation.

## Features
- Video frame extraction and processing
- Scene summarization and key visual detail extraction
- Text-to-speech for audio narration
- Integration with a movie database (optional)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/bhuvika-agrawal/accessible-cinema.git`
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Future Work
- Implementing deep learning models for video understanding
- Exploring text-to-speech synthesis for dynamic narration
